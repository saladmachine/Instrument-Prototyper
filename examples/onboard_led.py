Pico W 2 Onboard LED Blinky Example

This example demonstrates how to control and blink the onboard LED of the
Raspberry Pi Pico W 2. It's a fundamental 'Hello World' for microcontrollers,
verifying basic digital output functionality.

The onboard LED on the Pico W 2 is connected to GPIO25, which CircuitPython
maps to `board.LED`.
