Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W WiFi Hotspot Web Server
=============================================

A simple WiFi hotspot and web server implementation for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W
using CircuitPython. Creates an open WiFi access point and serves a basic webpage
to connected devices.

Hardware Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (RP2350 with WiFi)
- USB power source

Software Requirements:
- CircuitPython 9.2.7 or later
- adafruit_httpserver library

Installation:
1. Install CircuitPython on your Pico 2 W
2. Copy adafruit_httpserver library to /lib/ folder
3. Save this file as code.py on the CIRCUITPY drive

Usage:
1. Power on the Pico 2 W
2. Look for "PicoTest" in your device's WiFi networks
3. Connect to "PicoTest" (no password required)
4. Open a web browser and navigate to: http://192.168.4.1
5. You should see a success page served by the Pico 2 W

Network Configuration:
- SSID: PicoTest
- Security: Open (no password)
- IP Address: 192.168.4.1
- Subnet: 255.255.255.0
- DHCP: Enabled (devices get 192.168.4.x addresses)
